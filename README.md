## How to contribute to this repo

### Fork and clone

* Learn the basics about git, especially the "Getting Started" and "Git Basics" sections in this book: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

* Get a GitHub account if you don't have one already. Recommended user name if in doubt: `firstnamefamilyname` with no capital letters and no hyphens.

* Install git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

* Make a **fork** of lunduniversity/introsofteng in GitHub to your own GitHub account: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

* **Clone** your fork to your local computer: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/

### Keeping your fork in synch

* If you install the GitHub client (avaliable for Win and Mac but not Linux) called "GitHub desktop" https://desktop.github.com/ you can keep your fork in synch with the upstream repo by a single click in the GUI.

* Otherwise, this is how to pull changes from upstream to your fork with git commands: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

### Making contributions

* If you find a typo or minor issue that is straight-forward to fix you are very welcome to create a pull request directly as explained below. But if your contribution is more significant you should open an issue first and start a discussion about your proposal. In the latter case, click the issue tab at the top of this page.

* Before you change locally, make sure your fork is in synch (see above). Frequently do `git pull` or press the synch button in the GitHub desktop GUI.

* You must check that your fix compiles (to LaTeX or bytecode) before you commit.

* Whenever you are ready with an incremental change, run `git commit -m "msg"` and then `git push`, or commit in the GUI and press the synch button. Write a useful commit message.

* When you are ready with a contribution that is good enough to be incorporated in upstream, then create a pull request: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

* Keep your pull requests minimal and coherent to create a small change sets that will be easy to merge as a single unit. Don't pack a lot of unrelated changes in the same pull request.

* Don't include pdf:s or binaries in the pull request. The maintainers will recompile the repo after your pull request has been merged. You can then checkout your pdf:s before you synch with upstream.
